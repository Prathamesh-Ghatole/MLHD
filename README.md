### This repo hosts cleanup routines for the Music Listening Histories Dataset!

MLHD.ipynb -> All analytics and test code
_other files_ -> Functions from MLHD.ipynb split into manageable modules.

### Note:
- ```random_file_paths.txt``` contains a random sample of files. Use this for testing.
- New random sample can be generated using the ```gen_test_paths.py``` module.
